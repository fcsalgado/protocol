# **Measuring heating rates**

## **What do you need?**

1. Tripod 
2. Camera
3. Colour reference chart
4. Weight scale
5. CO2 set up
6. Thermal chamber
7. Thermometer and thermocouples 
8. Cooling/Heating Recirculating chiller

## **Current set up**

### CO2 setup

## **Things to do before you begin**

1. Turn on the Cooling/Heating Recirculating chiller one hour before the begging of the experiment
2. Locate the platform of the solar simulator at height of 209 mm
3. Turn on the fans and the bulb of the solar simulator (intensity 66%) 20 minutes before the begging of the experiment
4. Keep the protective glasses near to you and apply some sunscreen!

## **Follow protocol**

1. Put the individual you want to measure into the CO2 system for at least 10 min at room temperature
2. Take dorsal and ventral photos of the individual using the photograph setup, try to manipulate the sample with tweezers
3. Measure the weight of the individual
4. Open the chamber and insert the thermocouple into the spinnerents of the individual
5. Let the air temperature inside the chamber reach a constant temperature of 20 Â°C for five minutes
6. Open the shutter of the solar simulator and start the measures in the Thermometer software for 10 min measuring every 10 min (Don't forget to use UV protection in this step)
7. When the measure is finished, close the shutter of the solar simulator and remove the thermocouple inside the individual
8. Save the file
9. Measure the heating rate exposing the dorsal and ventral side of every individual to the solar simulator light
